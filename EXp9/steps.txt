To complete **Exercise No: 9 (Multiple Regression Analysis)** based on your lab manual, you need to use three variables instead of two. While the title says "Multiple Regression," your algorithm specifically mentions adding **Dose**, **Blood Pressure**, and **Recovery Time**.

### 1. The Multiple Regression CSV Data

Copy this data and save it as `multiple_regression.csv`. Since the image doesn't show a specific table for these new variables, I have provided a standard sample set that will work perfectly with your lab's instructions for Dose, Blood Pressure, and Recovery Time.

```csv
Dose,Blood_Pressure,Recovery_Time
2.0,140,15
2.5,145,14
3.0,138,12
3.5,130,10
4.0,128,9
4.5,125,8
5.0,120,7
2.2,142,15
2.8,135,11
3.2,132,10

```

### 2. SPSS Procedure (Follow Exactly)

Based on your lab manual's "Procedure", follow these exact steps:

#### Step A: Variable Setup

1. **Open SPSS** and go to **Variable View**.
2. Enter the names: `Dose`, `Blood_Pressure`, and `Recovery_Time`.
3. Set all types to **Numeric**.

#### Step B: Run the Multiple Regression

1. Go to **Analyze** > **Regression** > **Linear...**.
2. **Define Variables:**
* Move `Recovery_Time` into the **Dependent** box.
* Move `Dose` and `Blood_Pressure` into the **Independent(s)** box.


3. Click **OK**.

#### Step C: Generate the Scatter Plot

1. Go to **Graphs** > **Legacy Dialogs** > **Scatter/Dot...**.
2. Choose **Simple Scatter** and click **Define**.
3. Fill the **X-Axis** (e.g., Dose) and **Y-Axis** (e.g., Recovery Time).
4. Click **OK**.

### 3. Understanding Your Result

After running these steps, check your output window:

* **Model Summary:** Look for  and . This tells you how strongly Dose and Blood Pressure together influence Recovery Time.
* **ANOVA Table:** If the **Sig.** value is **< 0.05**, your multiple regression model is a significant predictor of recovery.
* **Coefficients:** This gives you the equation:



**Final Result for Lab:** "The multiple regressions have been computed successfully".
