To perform a **Paired Samples T-Test** in SPSS, you need two distinct columns: one for the "Before" measurements and one for the "After" measurements. This allows SPSS to compare the change within each specific participant.

### The Paired Samples CSV Data

Copy the block below and save it as `weight_program_test.csv`. I have paired each "Before" weight with its corresponding "After" weight from your handwritten table:

```csv
Weight_Before,Weight_After
189,170
202,179
220,203
207,192
197,172
177,161
193,174
202,187
208,186
233,204

```

### How to Run the Paired Samples T-Test in SPSS

1. **Import the CSV:** Go to **File > Import Data > CSV** and select your file.
2. **Define the Variables:** Switch to **Variable View** and ensure both `Weight_Before` and `Weight_After` are set to **Measure: Scale**.
3. **Run the Analysis:**
* Go to **Analyze > Compare Means > Paired-Samples T-Test**.
* Select both `Weight_Before` and `Weight_After` together.
* Click the arrow button to move them into the **Paired Variables** list as a single pair (Variable1: `Weight_Before`, Variable2: `Weight_After`).
* Click **OK**.

### What to Look for in Your Results

When the output window opens, focus on the **Paired Samples Test** table:

* **Mean Difference:** This shows the average weight loss (Before - After).
* **Sig. (2-tailed):** This is your p-value.
* **If p < 0.05:** The weight-reducing program has a **significant impact**. You can conclude the program works.
* **If p > 0.05:** There is no significant difference, meaning the program might not be effective.



Looking at your data, there is a clear drop in every single participant's weight, so you should expect a very low p-value (likely **p < 0.001**), showing the program is highly effective.
