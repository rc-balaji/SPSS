To perform a **One-Way ANOVA** in SPSS, you need to organize your data into two columns: one for the **Marks** (Dependent Variable) and one for the **Drug_Type** (Factor/Independent Variable).

### 1. The CSV Data

Copy the content below and save it as `anova_marks_test.csv`. I have coded the treatments as numbers: `1 = Memory Drug`, `2 = Placebo`, and `3 = No Treatment`.

```csv
Marks,Drug_Type
70,1
77,1
83,1
90,1
97,1
37,2
43,2
50,2
57,2
63,2
3,3
10,3
17,3
33,3
30,3

```

### 2. How to Set This Up in SPSS

1. **Import the CSV:** Go to **File > Import Data > CSV** and select your file.
2. **Define Variable Values:**
* Go to **Variable View**.
* Click on the **Values** cell for `Drug_Type`.
* Add: `1` = `Memory Drug`, `2` = `Placebo`, `3` = `No Treatment`.


3. **Run the ANOVA:**
* Go to **Analyze > Compare Means > One-Way ANOVA**.
* Move `Marks` into the **Dependent List**.
* Move `Drug_Type` into the **Factor** box.
* Click **Post Hoc** and select **Tukey** (to see exactly which groups differ if the result is significant).
* Click **Continue** and then **OK**.

### 3. What Your Results Mean

Focus on the **ANOVA table** and the column labeled **Sig.** (the p-value):

* **If Sig. < 0.05:** There is a **significant difference** in marks based on the drug treatment. You should then look at the "Post Hoc" table to see which specific drug performed better.
* **If Sig. > 0.05:** There is no significant difference between the treatments.

Looking at your handwritten data, the Memory Drug group (70-97) scores much higher than the No Treatment group (3-33), so you should expect a very high significance (low p-value).

Would you like me to help you interpret the **Tukey Post Hoc** table once you've generated the output?
