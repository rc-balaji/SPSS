To help you finish your lab workbook, here is the data generation and the exact step-by-step guide for **Exercise No: 10 (Kruskal-Wallis Test)** as it usually follows the sequence of your previous images.

### 1. The CSV Data (Kruskal-Wallis Test)

Since this is a non-parametric version of ANOVA, you need one column for the **Score** and one column for the **Group**. Save this as `kruskal_wallis_test.csv`.

```csv
Score,Group
15,1
18,1
12,1
10,1
14,1
25,2
22,2
28,2
24,2
26,2
8,3
7,3
11,3
9,3
10,3

```

### 2. SPSS Procedure (Follow Exactly)

Based on standard lab manual procedures for this test:

#### Step A: Variable Setup

1. **Open SPSS** and go to **Variable View**.
2. Define `Score` as **Numeric** (Scale).
3. Define `Group` as **Numeric** (Nominal).
4. Under **Values** for Group, set: `1 = Group A`, `2 = Group B`, `3 = Group C`.

#### Step B: Run the Kruskal-Wallis Test

1. Go to **Analyze** > **Nonparametric Tests** > **Legacy Dialogs** > **K Independent Samples...**.
2. Move `Score` into the **Test Variable List**.
3. Move `Group` into the **Grouping Variable** box.
4. Click **Define Range** and set Minimum to `1` and Maximum to `3`. Click **Continue**.
5. Ensure **Kruskal-Wallis H** is checked.
6. Click **OK**.
