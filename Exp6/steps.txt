To perform the **Two-Way ANOVA** in SPSS as shown in your images, you must organize the data into three columns: one for the **Workman**, one for the **Machine**, and one for the **Defects** (the count of defective pieces).

### 1. The CSV Data for Two-Way ANOVA

Copy this data and save it as `two_way_anova.csv`. I have followed the table from your image exactly.

```csv
Workman,Machine,Defects
1,1,27
1,2,34
1,3,23
2,1,29
2,2,32
2,3,25
3,1,22
3,2,30
3,3,22

```

### 2. SPSS Variable Setup

Before running the test, set your **Variable View** in SPSS to match the "Procedure" in your lab notes:

* **Variable 1:** `Workman` (Type: Numeric, Measure: Nominal).
* **Values:** 1 = "Workman 1", 2 = "Workman 2", 3 = "Workman 3".


* **Variable 2:** `Machine` (Type: Numeric, Measure: Nominal).
* **Values:** 1 = "Machine 1", 2 = "Machine 2", 3 = "Machine 3".


* **Variable 3:** `Defects` (Type: Numeric, Measure: Scale).

### 3. Step-by-Step Analysis Procedure

Follow these exact steps from your lab manual to generate the results:

1. Go to the **Analyze** menu.
2. Select **General Linear Model**.
3. Click **Univariate**.
4. In the **Univariate** dialogue box:
* Move `Defects` to the **Dependent Variable** box.
* Move `Workman` and `Machine` to the **Fixed Factor(s)** box.


5. Click **OK** to get the output.

### 4. Interpreting Your Hypothesis

As per your notes, you are testing the following:

* ** (Null):** There is no significant difference in defects for the different combinations of workman and machine.
* ** (Alternative):** There is a significant difference in the defects for the different combinations.

**Next Step:** Once you run the test, check the **Tests of Between-Subjects Effects** table. Look at the **Sig.** column for "Workman" and "Machine" separately. If the value is less than **0.05**, that factor has a significant impact on defects.

Would you like me to help you write down the final **Result** based on the p-values you see in your SPSS output?
