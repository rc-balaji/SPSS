It looks like there was a slight mix-up in how the data was imported or entered into SPSS.

Looking at your screenshot, SPSS has treated each number in your list as a **separate variable** () instead of putting all the numbers into **one single column** under `Running_KM`. For a One-Sample T-Test, you need all 100 observations to be in a single vertical column.

### The Correct CSV Format

To fix this, your CSV file must have the header on the first line, and then every single number must be on a **new line** below it.

**Copy and save this exact block as a CSV:**

```csv

### How to Import it Correctly

1. **Clear your current SPSS sheet:** Go to `File > New > Data`.
2. **Import:** Go to `File > Import Data > CSV`.
3. **Check the Preview:** When the import window pops up, look at the preview. You should see **one column** named `Running_KM` with the numbers going down from row 1 to 110.
4. **Finish:** Click OK.

### Why this matters for your T-Test

When you go to **Analyze > Compare Means > One-Sample T-Test**, SPSS expects you to move one variable into the "Test Variables" box. With your current "sideways" data, SPSS thinks you have 15 different types of data instead of 100 samples of the same thing.
